      <p>
        I am still finding myself as an artist but so far what have intrigued me most include net art, audio engineering,
        generative design, and graphic design. I have discovered through coursework that my style leans more towards eerie,
        glitchy aesthetics but also quirky and whimsical themes. As an artist, I care about expressing myself and having an
        impact on others. I want to introduce new ideas to the art scene.
          The subjects I explore in my work are often things that make me feel vulnerability, fear, passion, awe, or other
        strong emotions. I draw a lot of inspiration from my memories, dreams, and fantasies. For example, my short film On
        a Trip is fundamentally a retelling of a crazy, eventful day I had, while my net art pieces <span>
          <a href="https://converttosmartobject.github.io/therapet/">Therapet</a></span> and <span>
            <a href="https://converttosmartobject.github.io/interactwithintercat/">Interact with Intercat</a></span> were influenced by my desire to own a cat at the time because I was feeling sad and wanted something fuzzy to cuddle.
        <br>

      My portfolio not only displays my art but it is in and of itself an art piece. It is yet another interactive net art project
      composed of artistic intention and carefully arranged elements of design. I really enjoy code as an art medium, I like the
      unpredictability of the projects I make with code turn out to have. Because I am still familiarizing myself with net art and
      different programming languages, my projects frequently deviate from my original plans as I experiment with the code trying to
      carry those plans out. For instance, my project <span><a href="https://converttosmartobject.github.io/www/">WWW</a></span> was initially supposed to be a game where a spider is dodging tweezers that
      are trying to pluck off its legs. As I continued working on the game, I ran into bugs and ended up playing with the code a lot
      which steered the project into a whole new direction. Now it is an interactive animation where the spider recites Walt Whitman
      poetry and weaves a web that represents the World Wide Web.

        My art making process is spontaneous for the most part, many of my works move away from the initial ideas I had for them. This
        reflects my art style and interests because I love the seemingly random, fantastical, and dream-like flow of things and want to
        incorporate that theme into my work.
