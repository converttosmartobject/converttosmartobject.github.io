        <h2>this portfolio is no longer in use and i've removed most of its content. please visit www.o-que.com to see my new portfolio.</h2>
      <p>While I like to explore all mediums within digital media, I trend towards design and creative code.<br>
        I work art into everything I do. For instance, I find gratification in working narratives and concepts into
        the organization of the desktop icons on my computer, the books on my bookshelf, etcetera. I work this same kind of
        eccentric organization into my artwork.<br><br>

        I like to go with the flow while Iâ€™m creating, finding a rhythm in the repetition and embracing the lessons<br>
        (and occasional beauty) that mistakes bring. I enjoy exploring different software and mediums, not really being
        tied down to one, instead searching for interesting possibilities in whatever tool I happen to be using in the moment.<br><br>

        My portfolio not only displays my art but it is in and of itself an art piece. It is one of my several interactive net
        art projects composed with artistic intention and carefully arranged elements of design. I really enjoy code as a medium,
        I like the unpredictability that the projects I make with code have. Because I am still familiarizing myself with net art
        and different programming languages, my projects frequently deviate from my original plans as I experiment with the code.<br><br>

        My art making process is spontaneous for the most part, many of my works move away from the initial ideas I had <br>for them.
        This reflects my art style and interests because I love the seemingly random, fantastical, and dream-like flow of things
        and want to incorporate that theme into my work. The challenges in creating good design work are fun puzzles to me, not burdensome hurdles.<br><br>

        I have always been fascinated with net art and generative design. I have noticed that my interest and exploration of UX/UI affects my
        artwork across all mediums. I would like to pursue web development and interface design in the future, as for me they are the most
        enjoyable and rewarding artistic processes.
